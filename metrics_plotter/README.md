## What can be improved?

- Improve already existing fundamental components variability
- Make big improvements in the chart component by adding a lot more of variability and functionalities
- Improve re-rendeding
- Add components and funcionalities testing (is a must)
- Add loading animations
- Add notification component, modal component and other fundamental components
- Add accesibility properties to every component
