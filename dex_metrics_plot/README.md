# Web application

##### A React based Web app that connects to an api server an displays a beautiful chart you can interact with!

---

## How it was made and Why?

- This Web app was created in base of several fundamental components
- This fundamental components brings the modularity needed to create a very easy, responsive, fast and readeable way to create new components.
- Code duplication is near to inexistent
- This app could be a good point of start for a templating library

## What can be improved?

- Improve already existing fundamental components variability
- Make big improvements in the chart component by adding a lot more of variability and functionalities
- Improve re-rendeding
- Pass all code to typescript (is a must)
- Add components and funcionalities testing (is a must)
- Use multipleSelector for every set of buttons
- Add notification component, modal component and other fundamental components
- Add accesibility properties to every component
- Add more content
- Add theme context, user context
- Add tracking driver, track user interaction over the Web app, create events and create an external Web app user interaction metrics system. (in very advanced development)
